# Xamarin.Forms-Custom-Renderers

This is a Xamarin.Forms application for drawing, using multiple colors and platform-specific controls.

Objectives accomplished:

1) Created a platform-specific native control and embedded it into a Xamarin.Forms layout.

2) Extended a renderer to add new behavior to an existing Xamarin.Forms element.

3) Created a custom element in Xamarin.Forms and added a bindable property to the element.

4) Created renderers that instantiate custom, platform specific controls for a custom defined Xamarin.Forms element. 
   Also created and used a bindable property to update the renderers.
   
5) Sent notifications between the shared element and platform-specific renderers without tightly 
   coupling the renderer instance to the element.
